You should edit the JSX file in `src/` and re-compile it into the `js/` directory using JSX for viewing/deployment.

You can install JSX using `npm install jsx` and re-compile the JSX file using the following command on a Mac:

    jsx src/app.jsx >! js/app.js

I did try getting this all working using grunt but failed :(
